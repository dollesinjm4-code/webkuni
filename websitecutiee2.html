      <div class="overlay">
        This photo captures my deep passion for playing basketball. It was taken during the finals game, a moment filled
        with intensity, teamwork, and determination. Through this image, you can truly see the unity and strong
        connection within my team — each player contributing their individual ideas, skills, and strategies to achieve a
        common goal: victory. Beyond just a game, this experience symbolizes how collaboration, trust, and shared effort
        can lead to success. This photo not only reminds me of that triumph but also represents the deep bond we built
        both on and off the court.

      <div class="overlay">
        This drawing reflects my inner ability and passion for art. Using Adam as my reference, I poured my creativity
        and dedication into every detail, allowing my deep love for the arts to guide me throughout the process. It took
        me three days to complete this piece, and during that time, I discovered not only my patience and focus but also
        how art allows me to express myself in meaningful and inspiring ways.

      <div class="overlay">
        This photo was taken in General Santos City at the beautiful Isla Jardin resort. I captured this moment because
        I felt a deep sense of peace and was inspired by my love for photography. The image represents more than just a
        scenic view — it symbolizes how I see myself in the waves of life. Just like the ocean, life has its calm and its
        storms, but I believe that through peace, understanding, and faith in God’s creations, every challenge can be
        resolved. This photo reminds me to stay grounded and to always find beauty and serenity even in life’s constant
        motion.

      <div class="overlay">
        This photo truly gives me a sense of relief and brings back wonderful memories of the activities we shared during
        that time. It captures not only my love for nature but also my deep appreciation for how amazing God is in
        creating such beautiful things around us. During this adventure, I experienced moments of realization and
        reflection that opened my heart and mind, helping me understand life more clearly. It was through this journey
        and with the company and support of these wonderful people that I felt closer to God and more connected to the
        beauty of His creations.
