      <h1>Hi, I am <span class="highlight-name">JM Dollesin</span><br>
        A Computer Science Student in <span class="highlight-city">South Philippine Adventist College.</span>
      </h1>
      <p>I am an active and creative individual with a strong passion for both sports and the arts. I particularly enjoy
        playing basketball, as it allows me to develop discipline, teamwork, and strategic thinking. In addition to my
        athletic interests, I have a deep appreciation for visual arts, including portrait drawing and photography, which
        enable me to express creativity and attention to detail. I also value meaningful experiences and enjoy spending
        time with friends on outdoor adventures that foster connection and personal growth.</p>

    <p>&copy; Rooted in faith, I am guided by the belief that every talent and opportunity is a gift from God, meant to be
      used for His glory. As 1 Peter 4:10 reminds us, “Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve
      others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.”</p>
